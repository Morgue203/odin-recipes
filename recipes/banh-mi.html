      <strong>Description</strong>
    </h2>
      <p>
        Fresh ingredients, delicious, popular and fills your mouth with marinated joy. You can usually find the high-caloric sandwich 
        (variety of meat on mayonnaise) in your local Vietnamese baguette shop but here is a hearty Vegetarian version (if you do not use fish sauce) 
        using portabello mushroom.

      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
      </li>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the mushrooms on a baking sheet. Drizzle with a little olive oil and 
        season with salt and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Coll slightly, then slice into strips.
      </p>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
      </li>
      <p>
        While the mushrooms are roasting, bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Plunge the carrot and radish sticks into the boiling water and after 
        a few seconds, remove them and plunge them into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. In a separate bowl, stir together the rice vinegar, 
        1/2 cup of lime juice and 1/2 cup cold water. Transfer the carrot and radish to the vinegar and lime marinade and let them soak for at least 
        15 minutes, longer if it's convenient.
      </p>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
      </li>
      <p>
        In a small bowl, stir together the remaining lime juice, soy sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, canola oil, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup water. This 
        is the sandwich sauce.
      </p>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
      </li>
      <p>
        To assemble sandwiches, sprinkle a little of the sandwich sauce onto each half of the French loaves. Place the roasted mushrooms onto the bottom 
        half of each roll and sprinkle with a little more sauce. top with a few slices of jalapeno, a few sticks of carrot and radish (minus the marinade), 
        cucumber, basil and cilantro. Close with the tops of the bread and serve.
